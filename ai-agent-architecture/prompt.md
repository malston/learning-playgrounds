# AI Agent Architecture Prompt

Teach me how AI agents actually work. Not the buzzwords. The architecture. How routing, orchestration, and delegation actually fit together. For example:

- What makes an agent different from a chatbot
- 4 core patterns (routing, orchestration, delegation, reflection)
- When to use single vs multi-agent systems
- How each pattern maps to actual code
