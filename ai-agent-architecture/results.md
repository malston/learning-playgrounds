Interactive concept map with 15 nodes across 5 categories:

- Foundation: LLM → Chatbot → Agent (the progression from raw model to autonomous agent)
- Components: Tool Use, Memory, Planning (what agents are made of)
- Patterns: Routing, Orchestration, Delegation, Reflection (the 4 architectural patterns)
- Systems: Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent (when to use which)
- Roles: Supervisor, Worker, Evaluator (who does what in multi-agent systems)

  How to use it:

- Click any node to see its description, real pseudocode, when to use it, and its connections
- Click the colored dot on a node to cycle knowledge level (Know / Fuzzy / Unknown)
- Drag nodes to rearrange the map to match your mental model
- Use presets at the top ("I'm new", "I know chatbots", etc.) to quickly set knowledge levels
- Copy the prompt at the bottom -- it builds a personalized learning request based on your knowledge gaps

Each node includes concrete implementation code showing how the pattern actually works, not just theory.
