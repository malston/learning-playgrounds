Interactive concept map with 15 nodes across 5 categories:

- Foundation: LLM, Chatbot, Agent
- Components: Tool Use, Memory, Planning
- Patterns: Routing, Orchestration, Delegation, Reflection
- Systems: Single-Agent, Multi-Agent
- Roles: Supervisor, Worker, Evaluator

How to use it:

- Click any node to see its description, pseudocode implementation, and when to use it
- Click the colored dot on a node (or use the detail panel buttons) to cycle knowledge level: Know / Fuzzy / Unknown
- Drag nodes to rearrange the map to match your mental model
- Use presets to quickly set knowledge levels ("I'm new", "I know chatbots", etc.)
- Copy the prompt at the bottom -- it generates a personalized learning request based on what you know vs. don't know

Each pattern includes real pseudocode showing the actual code structure, not just theory.
